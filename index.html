  <h2> What is Career Development? </h2> 

  <p>Career development is the process of <em>learning and utilizing</em> short-term skills to progress
     toward long-term professional goals. This process is often lifelong and involves steadily
     reaching milestones specific to your designated career path. Much of career development calls for reflection and
     the exploration of purpose in your work, and is the foundation for achieving larger career growth. </p>

   <p>A career path can be visualized as a ladder, with each rung symbolizing the level of a role on the path.
